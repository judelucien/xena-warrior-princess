# Welcome to the world of Fan Fiction!

## :bangbang: :bangbang: DISCLAMER :bangbang: :bangbang:

Before you settle in with a cup or glass of something soothing to chill and read with, you should know that some of these links may lead to stories that are... well... saucy :scream:

Very saucy. There are all sorts of shenanigans going on. Not in all stories. Most if not all stories have further disclaimers about the contents when you land on them.

I am telling you here before you get that far. If the "L" of LGBT freaks you out, you are probably in the wrong place. Just sayin'.

### FURTHER DISCLAIMERS...

GitHub does not host any of these stories. None of the content here on GitHub is saucy in any way.

## Now that is out of the way...
